## Project Introduction

This project contains a collection of water analysis functions written in MATLAB. MATLAB files denoted as scripts are executable. The additional files comprise the MATLAB functions used in running the program.

These functions are designed to be generic implementations and can be used with any MATLAB vector / matrix data.


## Objectives
The objective of this project is to design and implement a decision support system (DSS) in the form of a modular
MATLAB code that will evaluate the flooding potential at a stream site and characterize the quality of the stream habitat at this site based on water quality parameters with regard to road salt, fish health, and invertebrate health.
